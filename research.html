  <h1>Photoacoustic 2D Image Classification and Segmentation - Breast Cancer</h1>
  <h2>Anika Sharmin</h2>
  
  <p>Photoacoustic computed tomography (PAT) is an emerging imaging modality that shows promise in early-stage breast cancer detection. For imaging modalities used clinically, a wide range of image analysis software is usually available for aid in diagnosis. As PAT is still not used in clinical settings, it has very few of these image analysis tools available for it, but they would greatly help its development and performance. In this project, a simulated virtual 2D PA breast image dataset was used to build classification and segmentation tools for cancer diagnosis using deep learning neural networks. The classifier differentiates not only between healthy and cancerous breasts, but also between different types of lesions according to their microvascular environment, while the segmentation tool localizes and separates the lesions from the rest of the breast. The classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.80, with a sensitivity of 0.90 and specificity of 0.83, while the segmentation algorithm showed an accuracy and IoU of 0.95 and 0.51 respectively. While the performances of both are not to a satisfactory level, the results show that using a larger dataset could greatly improve performance. The results are therefore encouraging since a very limited dataset was used in this project, so obtaining a larger dataset should be relatively easy in future works. Other limitations of the project include anatomically inaccurate tumour microvasculature and oversimplified PAT simulations, which future projects could endeavour to improve on.

  <p style="color:purple"><i>This was a self-proposed project and frankly I bit off more than I could chew. I was unable to verify a lot of things including the validity of my generated images.
I can't really consider it "proper" research but I did learn a lot.</i></p>
