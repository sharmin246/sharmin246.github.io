Let's try this again!<br>
Use style.css for making changes to the overall look of the website<br>
Use inline or internal CSS for individual pages<br>
Also if we face deployment issues again, we switch to a new platform but keep working on the html files on this repo.<br>
<br>
If you guys wanna write about your own individual research experiences, job experiences, or projects, feel free to do so. Just go into the html file for any of them and just follow the format of the articles already done.
